This is my website!

It's very poor right now, so I'm working on a new one!

Feel free to fork, spinoff, pr, comment.

Have fun here!

## About the new site

### Building
`grunt`

If you grunt is not found, install it(could be any package manager) `npm install -g grunt`

If modules are not found, install them `npm install --production`

### Demands
* Must be easy to use 
* Must be fun
* Must be accessible(colorblinds, dyslectics)
* Must be a little future-compatible(for example, not storing the data in the HTML, but in something else)
* Must be responsive
* Must respect the user's privacy
* My mom must understand it
* Must not be poor 1999 HTML
* Must encourage to upgrade from your old Internet Explorer

### FAQ
* *No libraries? Not even jquery? Are you crazy?!*
Nope. I wanted to learn stuff when building my website, and making things from scratch has funny results.
I'd never had that fancy threejs background if I used a template. I wouldn't understand CSS, either. And it resulted me into reporting a bug in chrome, too.
And... It's very fun! I learned a lot! I now actually now how the magic works!
But if you looked at my code you see I used a library, [three.js](http://threejs.org)!

* *What tools do you use to make the website?*

	Tooltype | What I use
	--- | ---
	Editor | I don't know! Help!
	Source Control | Git!
	Browser | Chrome or chromium. But I build it for all modern browsers!


* *Does CSS make you cry?*
Yes, ~~sometimes~~ most of the time.
