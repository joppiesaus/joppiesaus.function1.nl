Also pick lots of sugar because you like lots of sugar. Don't lie to me.<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-roman\"><li>Heat up both pans. Make them hot, but make sure you don't burn them. This is not easy I already destroyed lots of pans but my mom never gets mad because I try<li>Now when they're hot put some corn in it. A few table spoons. As much as possible, but make sure they don't stack onto each other.<li>Put the other pan onto the pan<li>Wait. This is the hardest phase. Keep the pan hot, but don't make it too hot, you'll burn the popcorn.<li>Get nervous<li>Question life<li>Hear the relieving sound of popping popcorn<li>Now wait again until the war between the popcorn is finally over<li>Whoa it is war in there<li>Okay turn the gas low, put sugar in it. I reccommend 2 or 3 times the amount of table spoons of sugar as you put corn in it. You can do more of course :))))<li>wait for the sugar to carmilize<li>Get more nervous this time<li>See it carmilizing? Good!
