<h3 class="center und">About me</h3>

<b>Who I am:</b><br>
I am Job van der Zweep!(AKA joppiesaus)☻
I am a <span id="myage">???(If you want to know my age you have to enable Javascript!)</span> year old geek from holland who likes almost everything about computers. Especially programming!<br>
I started programming arround my 12'th year. Before that I was making stuff with batch without really know what I was doing(I didn't even know it was called programming...)
I know lots of languages: C#, batch, HTML(if <i>you call that a programming language...</i>), javascript(but that's confusing). I am learning(or having little knowledge): PHP, C++, Java, BlitzBasic(and some more, but I am bad at keeping things like this updated)!<br>
I also LOVE to customize and build pc's(<a href="/div/mypc/">Here's my own!</a>). And I try fixing them too.<br>
I love science! People say I'm awesome in it! Even though science is sometimes really confusing it is <i>still</i> just screwing arround with writing it down.<br>
I love my <a href="mailto:cat@function1.nl">cat</a>. My cat doesn't love me. She loves Google though. It's a big evil corperation but still a damn fine search engine.<br>Also, I like joppiesaus!
<br><br>
<b>How I became a programmer:</b><br>
Well, when I first saw the computer, I mostly played games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajama_Sam">Pajama Sam</a>, and Howie's grote rekenavontuur. Those are the games where you can explore, and do what you want to do. 
<em>yes</em>, XP's pinball did it right to me, mspaint.exe was fun, but those where the games which I could play forever. I also played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen">Keen 5</a>.<br>
Then, there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a>. Again, I could do what I want, but I could this time create stuff how I like. I thought it was the best game ever. I still play it nowadays.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_empires_II">Age of Empires II</a> was another game I like. Pure strategy, I got old enough to understand it. I played with .bat files that time. I programmed without even knowing it. NFSU did also good to me.<br>
Than, there was the legendary <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, which had everything what I like: Exploring, building stuff, no limits. One day, my friend showed Minecraft Classic. I wanted a server, so I came out at 
<a href="http://mcdzienny.cba.pl">MCDzienny</a>. You could make custom commands, and I loved to make those. I started in Notepad, then I downloaded a IDE. I thought: This is everything for me. Coding. 
I started learning JavaScript at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">CodeCademy</a>, and coding more custom commands in C#(My best language so far). I followed tutorials for C#, and made neat stuff.<br>
<a href="http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal Space Program</a> is awesome. It had again the three parts of Minecraft, but than added more science. EVERYTHING FOR SCIENCE! Arround that time, I saw the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA">XNA Framework</a>, and started to code games. Of course, I learned more stuff.
And now, I am here. I made a website!
<br><br>I guess I like creating stuff. Do whatever you want. I think that's why I am a programmer; I want to create and understand.<br><br>

<b>Other stuff I want you to tell you:</b><br>
<ul><li>I'd love to hear some comments! ☻</li><li>All of this stuff on this paged has a nice disclaimer called "Works on my machine". What that means? Well I am a human and humans make mistakes... I am not a perfect programmer. If some software generates pictures of cats, yells at you for being stupid, deletes your favorite games, kills your pet or makes alien invasion happen: You have been warned. I don't expect any of this will happen, <a href="http://function1.nl/ques/tions.html">but you never know</a>.</li><li>Not everything by me is innovative, nice and awesome. Especially the early things I made aren't perfect. But that's OK, becuase the mistakes I make let me learn new stuff.</li><li id="license">All stuff on this page(except otherwise noted) is licensed under <a href="http://function1.nl/p/unlicense.txt">the unlicense</a> - which means do whatever you want(I encourage that) as long as you don't blame me for the consequences of what you did - except otherwise noted.</li></ul></div>
